Quarter-End Wrap – Sunday, September 28, 2025

Markets closed Q3 on a mixed note: the Nasdaq Composite rallied 2.4% this week as AI-linked semiconductors rebounded, while the Russell 2000 slipped 0.9% amid continued pressure on regional banks. Rebalancing flows injected late-session volatility into Friday’s close.

Macro data leaned supportive. Core PCE cooled to 2.6% year over year, the softest print since 2021, sparking hopes that policymakers are done hiking. Futures now price a 60% chance of the first rate cut arriving in March 2026.

Commodities were steady with Brent crude anchored near $87/bbl and copper flirting with $4.10/lb on strong Chinese imports. Meanwhile, Bitcoin surged past $68k as the SEC cleared two additional spot ETF listings.

Key watch items into the new quarter: Friday’s nonfarm payrolls, the reopening of Congress after the budget stopgap, and whether volatility sellers continue to dominate as realized swings grind lower.
