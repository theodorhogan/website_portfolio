Banks Beat, Guidance Cautious - Friday, January 16, 2026

Major banks beat on NII and trading but guided cautiously on credit costs. Financials initially rallied then faded; tech and industrials carried the indices higher into the long weekend.

10-year yields climbed to [4.08%]; credit spreads were little changed. WTI rose to $78 on colder weather; VIX held near [[15.1]].

Fed speakers reiterated data dependence; futures still price the first cut in June. Earnings broaden next week to semis, rails, and staples.
