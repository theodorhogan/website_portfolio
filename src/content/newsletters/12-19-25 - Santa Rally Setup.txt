Santa Rally Setup - Friday, December 19, 2025

Equities extended gains into year-end as seasonality and lighter issuance supported risk. Tech, semis, and discretionary outperformed; healthcare lagged on profit-taking.

10-year yields hovered near [3.88%]; credit spreads tightened another 4-5 bps in IG. VIX drifted to [[14.3]], while WTI held around $76.

Desk flows cited steady ETF inflows and reduced hedging demand. Next week is thin on data; liquidity expected to taper into the holidays.
