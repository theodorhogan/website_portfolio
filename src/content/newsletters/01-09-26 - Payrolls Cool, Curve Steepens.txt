Payrolls Cool, Curve Steepens - Friday, January 9, 2026

December payrolls came in at [[128k]] vs [(145k)] consensus; unemployment edged to [4.2%]. Equities reacted positively as a cooler labor print boosted odds of midyear easing; cyclicals led, defensives lagged.

The 10-year fell to [3.96%] while the 2-year dropped faster, steepening the curve. DXY softened; gold pushed to $2,470. VIX slipped back to [[14.8]].

Earnings pre-announcement season is quiet; banks kick off next week with loan growth and reserve build trends in focus.
