Earnings Kickoff Jitters - Friday, October 17, 2025

Stocks chopped sideways as the first wave of Q3 bank results came in mostly in line but guidance leaned cautious. Mega-cap tech faded into the close while small caps outperformed on short covering.

The 10s/2s spread steepened 6 bps with the 10-year near [4.38%]; WTI slipped below $79 on higher inventories; VIX hovered around [[17.0]]. Traders eye next week's mega-tech prints and the September PCE deflator [(2.6% y/y)] for direction.

Sector notes: Financials firmed after reserve releases, utilities lagged on higher rates sensitivity, and semis drifted lower ahead of earnings season.
