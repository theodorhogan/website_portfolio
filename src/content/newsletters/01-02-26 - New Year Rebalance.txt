New Year Rebalance - Friday, January 2, 2026

The first week of 2026 opened with mixed equity performance as pension and 60/40 rebalancing flows hit the tape. Value and small caps outperformed; mega-cap tech lagged after a strong Q4 run.

10-year yields rose to [4.02%]; the dollar firmed; WTI rebounded to $76. VIX ticked up to [[15.0]] but remained contained.

Investors look to next Friday's payrolls for confirmation that labor markets are cooling without breaking. FOMC minutes midweek will set the tone for January.
