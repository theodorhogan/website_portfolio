Weekly Market Pulse – Sunday, October 5, 2025

Equities capped off the first week of October with a broad-based climb. The S&P 500 added [+1.8%] as large-cap tech led the advance, while the Dow tacked on [-1.2%] thanks to strength in industrials. Investors shrugged off a hotter-than-expected ISM services print, betting that the Federal Reserve will maintain a wait-and-see stance until the December meeting.

Energy continued to outperform with WTI crude holding above $90/bbl after OPEC+ reiterated production discipline. Financials lagged as yield curves flattened on safe-haven buying; the 10-year Treasury yield slipped 9 bps to [4.16%].

In currency markets, the dollar index eased for a second straight week, boosting emerging market equities and precious metals. Spot gold closed at $2,120/oz, its highest level since May.

Looking ahead, the focus turns to corporate earnings. Mega-cap tech names kick off reporting season on Thursday, and options pricing implies elevated volatility into Friday’s expiration. Stay nimble—breadth is improving, but leadership remains narrow.
