October payrolls came in at [[162k]] vs [(145k)] consensus with unemployment at [4.1%]; markets read the print as "good enough" to keep the Fed on hold. Equities were mixed: tech higher, energy lower as WTI slipped back to $77.

Yields rose 4-6 bps across the curve; the 2s10s spread remained inverted. DXY firmed, while EUR/USD held near 1.07. VIX stayed contained at [[16.2]].

Earnings season wound down with consumer and travel names signaling steady demand but tighter promos into holiday. Focus shifts to CPI next week.
