End of Month Drift - Friday, January 30, 2026

Equities chopped sideways into month-end rebalancing. Staples and healthcare outperformed; energy lagged as WTI slipped back to $75. Small caps gave back some of January's gains.

The 10-year yield ticked up to [4.06%]; dollar steady; VIX held at [[15.3]]. Credit markets were quiet; HY issuance paused awaiting next week's payrolls.

Upcoming catalysts: January jobs (Friday) and ISM services (next Monday) will set the tone for early February.
