Fed Holds, Dot Plot Drifts - Friday, December 12, 2025

The Fed left rates unchanged and nudged the median 2026 dot down 25 bps. Chair Powell stressed flexibility. Equities closed higher with breadth solid; small caps outperformed.

The 10-year yield fell to [3.85%]; DXY dropped below 103.5; VIX slipped to [[14.7]]. WTI bounced to $77 on output headlines; nat gas softened.

Earnings were light; software M&A chatter resurfaced. Year-end positioning (CTA de-leveraging, buyback blackout easing) becomes the near-term driver.
