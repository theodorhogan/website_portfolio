Quiet Tape, Light Volume - Friday, December 26, 2025

Post-holiday trading stayed subdued; indices were little changed on very light volume. Retailers reported steady gift card redemptions; airlines flagged minor weather-related delays but no major disruptions.

The 10-year yield inched up to [3.93%]; dollar flat; WTI slipped to $74 on demand concerns. VIX remained anchored at [[14.1]].

With few catalysts, positioning and rebalancing drove moves. Eyes turn to the first trading week of 2026 for payrolls and ISM data.
