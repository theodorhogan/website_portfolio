Fed Focus Dispatch – Sunday, September 21, 2025

The FOMC held rates unchanged at 5.25% this week but shifted the dot plot lower, signaling two cuts penciled in for 2026. Chair Powell emphasized “data dependency,” yet equities celebrated the dovish tilt: the S&P 500 surged 2.1% with cyclicals in the lead.

Treasury yields slid across the curve, with the 2-year yield dropping 17 bps to 4.63%. That move reignited a rally in rate-sensitive sectors—homebuilders jumped 4.5% and utilities added 3.8%.

Credit spreads compressed as investment-grade issuance reopened; corporate borrowers priced $35B in fresh supply, deftly absorbed by investors hunting yield. Crude oil cooled to $86/bbl after the IEA forecasted a modest surplus for Q4.

Next up: flash PMIs on Monday, durable goods orders midweek, and a heavy slate of tech conferences that could guide sentiment for the final stretch of September.
